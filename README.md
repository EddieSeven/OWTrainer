# OWTrainer
Reddit bot that scans r/OverwatchUniversity for character specific guides, tips, and tricks. The program takes a character name as an argument, and a number when it's run, and returns the last [arg2] days worth of character guides, unless that character was patched.

If the character was patched, it'll use the date of release of that patch to calculate the length of the time frame.
